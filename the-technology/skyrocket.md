# Skyrocket

Skyrocket is the name for the technology that supports Skynet's exceptional speed and efficiency. It is the Remote Procedure Call \(RPC\) designed from scratch to specifically support the needs of Skynet, consisting of three main components:

1. **SiaMux** — a high performant, custom connection multiplexer
2. **Ephemeral Accounts** — a packetized payment technique to decrease latency and boost bandwidth by prepaying hosts
3. **Merklized Data Machine** — an optimized virtual machine, enabling the execution of complex, dynamic programs on file contracts while providing cryptographic proofs for every instruction

Chris Schinnerl , Core Developer at Skynet Labs, has written wonderful guides outlining each component.
